Problem Statement
    	
For any x ? y the interval [x,y] contains all real numbers between x and y, inclusive.

The length of the interval [x,y] is y-x.

Two intervals intersect if they have at least one number in common.



You are given the ints x1, y1, x2, and y2.

These are the endpoints of two intervals: [x1,y1] and [x2,y2].

We are looking for an interval [a,b] that intersects both given intervals.

Return the smallest possible length of the interval [a,b].
